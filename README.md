# Polysum
mitx 6.00.1x hw; calculate polysum of a polygon

**here are the requirements:**

A regular polygon has n number of sides. Each side has length s.

- The area of a regular polygon is: (0.25 * n * s^2) / tan(pi/n)
- The perimeter of a polygon is: length of the boundary of the polygon

Write a function called polysum that takes 2 arguments, n and s. This function should sum the area and square of the perimeter of the regular polygon. The function returns the sum, rounded to 4 decimal places.

*end of requirements*

second contribution of the day, i thought this was pretty ez lol. if you see any issues, please tell me
